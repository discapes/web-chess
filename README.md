You can try the app at [chess.miikat.dev](https://chess.miikat.dev).

## Get started
Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start Vite

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app in dist/:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`.
